1. EXCEPTION HANDLING, "try", "catch", "throw"

- Exception handling in C++ provides a more robust and flexible mechanism for dealing with exceptional situations, allowing for more modular, clean, and maintainable code. Instead of simply printing a message and exiting, exceptions allow for more refined error handling and make it easier to create more robust programs.

- Using exceptions with "try", "catch" and "throw" allows you to separate the main program logic from error handling.

- It allows exceptional situations to be managed in a controlled manner, preventing the program from abruptly closing (crash) due to an uncontrolled error.

- If exception handling is properly implemented, the program can react appropriately to unexpected situations, print informative error messages, and continue execution in a controlled manner.
